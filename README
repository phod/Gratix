About:
    This is a program that will convert mathematical descriptions of graphs
    to an adjacency matrix. Still in deisgn phase. Will probabily begin
    implementing within the next few weeks.

Features:
    Can read in a graph and it's verticies
    Can connect vertices with edges
    Can declare if a graph is weighted or not
    Can declare if a graph is directed or not
    Can give weighted graphs a default edge weight
    Can create sub and super graphs
    Can print an adjacency matrix
    Can remove edges and vertices
    Can add edges and vertices
